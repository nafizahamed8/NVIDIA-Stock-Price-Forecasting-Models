# NVIDIA Stock Price Forecasting Models

## Model Description

This repository contains two trained time series forecasting models for predicting NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) stock closing prices:

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A statistical model for time series forecasting
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A deep learning recurrent neural network model

Both models were trained on historical NVIDIA stock data from January 2020 to October 2025 and implement rolling window evaluation for realistic performance assessment.

## Model Details

### Model Architecture

**ARIMA Model:**
- **Type**: Statistical time series model
- **Order**: (0,1,0) - Random Walk model
- **Training Method**: Rolling window evaluation with expanding training set
- **Parameters**: Automatically determined through stationarity testing and ACF/PACF analysis

**LSTM Model:**
- **Type**: Deep learning recurrent neural network
- **Architecture**: Single-layer LSTM with 16 hidden units
- **Regularization**: Dropout (0.3) to prevent overfitting
- **Sequence Length**: 60 days (lookback period)
- **Training**: Rolling window retraining for each prediction

### Training Data

- **Stock**: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)
- **Time Period**: January 1, 2020 to October 2, 2025
- **Total Data Points**: 1,355 daily closing prices
- **Data Split**: 80% training (1,084 points), 20% testing (271 points)
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance via yfinance API

### Preprocessing

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and date formatting
2. **Stationarity Testing**: Augmented Dickey-Fuller test confirmed non-stationarity
3. **Differencing**: First-order differencing applied to achieve stationarity
4. **Normalization**: MinMax scaling (0-1) for LSTM training
5. **Sequence Creation**: 60-day windows for LSTM training

## Performance

### Evaluation Metrics

## Limitations

### ARIMA Limitations
- **Assumes linear relationships in data**
- **Limited ability to capture complex market dynamics**
- **Requires stationary data**
- **May underperform during high volatility periods**

### LSTM Limitations
- **Higher computational requirements**
- **Requires more data for optimal performance**
- **Black box nature limits interpretability**
- **Sensitive to hyperparameter tuning**

### General Limitations
- **Models trained on historical data only**
- **Cannot account for unexpected market events**
- **Performance may vary in different market conditions**
- **Not financial advice - use at own risk**

## Ethical Considerations

- **Financial Risk**: Stock predictions involve significant financial risk
- **No Investment Advice**: Models are for educational/research purposes only
- **Market Impact**: Large-scale use could potentially influence markets
- **Data Bias**: Historical biases may be reflected in predictions
